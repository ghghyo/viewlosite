For longer calls, additional fees are incurred depending on the total call duration, including a Stripe fee of .30 cents + 2.9% of each total transaction and tip. We encourage you to visit the Pricing section for a comprehensive breakdown of the costs per minute. To help you estimate the charges for your call, please use the fee estimator located below by inputting the expected call duration time.

This hold is part of our standard process to confirm your payment method and is required to initiate a call. It is not a final charge. After your call concludes, we will calculate the actual cost based on the duration and applicable rates for the service provided. Your final bill will then be adjusted to reflect only the charges for the service used, and the $1.99 hold will be released.

Simply tap on the screen while on the call to bring up the live command arrows. These commands allow you to direct the reporter to, for example, turn the camera or adjust the zoom. When you successfully issue a command, the corresponding arrow will illuminate in green to the broadcaster.
                            In the event that a broadcaster cannot fulfill a command, the arrows will turn red, indicating the inability to comply with the request. This intuitive system is designed to enhance communication and control during live interactions, ensuring a smooth and efficient call experience.

                            Yes, as an independent contractor, you are responsible for reporting your income to the IRS. If your earnings exceed $600 in a tax year, we will provide you with a 1099-MISC form, which is necessary for reporting independent contractor income. We recommend consulting with a tax specialist to ensure you understand and fulfill all your tax obligations accurately.
                            For additional information about earnings and payouts, please refer to the Payout FAQs on our platform. This resource can help you navigate the details of receiving and reporting your income, ensuring you remain compliant with tax regulations.
